# Computer Graphics and Visualization Lab

## Overview

This repository contains lab exercises and projects from the **Computer Graphics and Visualization Lab**. The course covers fundamental concepts of graphics programming using **Python**, exploring data types, line drawing algorithms, transformations, and 2D/3D visualizations with animations.

## Lab Exercises

### **Lab 1: Basics of Python & Data Types**

- Introduction to Python programming.
- Exploring data types using built-in libraries.

### **Lab 2: Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Line Algorithm**

- Implementing the **DDA Line Algorithm** for line generation.
- Understanding incremental calculations for efficient rendering.

### **Lab 3: Bresenham's Line Algorithm (BLA)**

- Implementing **Bresenham's Line Algorithm** for rasterized line drawing.
- Comparing it with the DDA algorithm in terms of efficiency.

### **Lab 4: Midpoint Circle Algorithm**

- Implementing the **Midpoint Circle Algorithm** to draw circles.
- Understanding decision parameter calculations.

### **Lab 5: Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm**

- Implementing the **Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm** for ellipse drawing.
- Exploring region-based computations.

### **Lab 6: 2D Transformations & Mechanical Clock**

- Applying **scaling, translation, rotation, reflection, and shearing** in 2D.
- Implementing a **mechanical clock** using transformations.

### **Lab 7: 3D Transformations & Visualization**

- Understanding **3D scaling, rotation, and translation**.
- Visualizing **3D elements with animations**.

## Additional Tasks & Projects
